You'll live a long time yet, Catherine\n
An eternity without me\n
You will look into the faces of passerby,\n
hoping for something that will,\n
for an instant, bring me back to you.\n
You will find moonlit nights strangly empty\n
because, when you call me name through them,\n
there will be no answer.\n
Always your heart will be aching for me and\n
your mind will give you the doubtful consolation\n
that you did "a brave thing"\n
